    Parameters:
        a (any type): The first operand.
        b (any type): The second operand.

    Returns -> any type: The type returned depends on the input types.

    Behavior:
        - If `a` and `b` are numbers, the minimum is returned.
        - If `a` and `b` are strings, the one with minimum length is returned.
        - If `a` and `b` are lists, the with minimum length is returned.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: if `a` and `b` are incompatible for comparison.
